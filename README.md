# Broome Codes
This project contains the code and presentations used for the event *Broome
Codes* at NYU's Broome Street dorm on October 25th, 2015.


## Installation
If you are new to coding or want to continue where you left off in the course,
you can download the files by clicking [Download
ZIP](https://github.com/rgardner/broome-codes/archive/master.zip) on this page.

Instead, if you have experience with [git](https://git-scm.com/), then just
clone the repo and start playing around with the various files.
