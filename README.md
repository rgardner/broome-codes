# Broome Codes
This project contains the code and presentations used for the event *Broome
Codes* at NYU's Broome Street dorm on October 25th, 2015.


## Installation
If you are new to coding or want to continue where you left off in the course,
you can download the files by clicking [Download
ZIP](https://github.com/rgardner/broome-codes/archive/master.zip) on this page.

Instead, if you have experience with [git](https://git-scm.com/), then just
clone the repo and start playing around with the various files.


## Getting Started
Now that you have the files downloaded, we need to set up our environment so we
can start writing and running the code.

### Terminal
To execute the Python code, we are going to use Mac's built-in Terminal
application. You can open this application using spotlight `cmd+spacebar` and
typing `Terminal` or by finding the application in `/Applications/Utilities.`

Once you've opened the Terminal application, drag the `broome-codes` folder
that you downloaded on to the Terminal application icon in your dock. This will
change the directory of your Terminal session to the `broome-codes` directory.

To test that everything is working, type `python3 print_test.py` and hit enter.
This will print out info about your computer and Python version.

Next, try running:

```
python print_test.py
python3 print_test.py
```

and see if they output different things (they most likely will!). There are two
major versions of Python currently, Python 2 and Python 3.

While the differences between the two are worth learning, for someone just
getting started I recommend just starting with Python 3. Python 3 is the future
of the language and it makes sense to start learning Python 3 now. This means
that when running a Python program, you should run it using `python3
program_name.py`.
